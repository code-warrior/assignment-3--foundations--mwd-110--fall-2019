      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <img src="img/IMG_0650.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Going back to my interest about cars, I've been a fan of motorsport from a young age. I had a little Porsche Carrera GT toy, so I started following Porsche's racing teams around the world, and then I found out they used to make engines for Formula One teams. I took an interest for Formula One a couple years ago and now I watch the races during the weekends. My favorite team is Scuderia Ferrari but I also root for Red Bull Racing since I'm also a Honda fan, and they supply engines to Red Bull. I hope one day to attend a Formula One race to see how those cars are driven around the track at very high speeds, and maybe get a closer look at the cars during practice sessions. </p>
      <p>My other major interest is mixing music. My uncle used to teach me and my cousins how to use dj equipment and software. Ever since I was taught how to mix, I've never stopped liking it because it's something really fun to do, and being able to perform at my uncle's nightclubs became a very fun activity to do every time I visited them back in Ecuador. I'm currently saving money to buy myself a professional deck for djing, and hope to become a part time dj during the summer. </p>
